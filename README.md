# Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
  Today I learn about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for both linear and non-linear classification problems using synthetic 2D datasets. This task involves training SVMs, tuning hyperparameters, visualizing decision boundaries, and evaluating performance using cross-validation.
and the tools a i used Scikit-learn: For creating datasets, building SVM models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation,NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation,Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing decision boundaries.
